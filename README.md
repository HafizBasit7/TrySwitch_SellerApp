## 🧩 Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

📱 Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal.
Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project.
Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
npm run android
# or
yarn android
